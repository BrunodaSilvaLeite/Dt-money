## 💵 Project

The 'Dt-money' 💵 project is an integral part of the [Ignite](https://app.rocketseat.com.br/ignite/react-js-2022) course, offered by Rocketseat. This project provided me with the opportunity to learn and apply a variety of concepts and technologies related to React ⚛️. Some of the topics covered include the use of styled-components, react-hook-form, zod, JSON server, axios, fetch, contextSelector, useCallback, and memo.
